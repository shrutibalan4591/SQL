# Interntional debt analysis
## Overview
Just like citizens go to a bank if they need money to grow economically, countries also approach the World Bank for loans to support development in their countries. In this project, you will explore countries' debts to the World Bank using SQL. <br/>

## Dataset
The dataset belongs to the World Bank and contains information about how much money countries worldwide owing to the Bank. It includes the following columns:
- Country_name: Full name of the country
- Country_code: Three-letter code for the country.
- Indicator_name: It specifies the motive behind the debt.
- indicator_code: Unique code for each indicator name
- debt: The amount borrowed as debt

## Questions
Using SQL commands on the dataset, we need to answer the following questions:
- What is the total amount of money that countries owe to the World Bank?
- Which country has the highest debt, and how much is that?
- What is the mean debt owed by countries for different debt indicators?
